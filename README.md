# CampusChat
CampusChat was a project I worked on for my college campus. I wanted to create an application
that would be used as a network for discussion on campus. My initial idea had people registering
accounts, but I soon realized that there was more engagement with anonymous discussion. However,
that gave way to other issues that many other apps have felt, so I decided to end the project.
